**talently is the easiest tool to find and connect with relevant software [app developers](https://upstaff.com/tools/talently-app-developer-in-one-click/) in minutes.**

Talently is a new Chrome extension that facilitates the process of identifying and connecting with skilled developers by analyzing content directly in your browser, available on any webpage—such as job postings on platforms like Indeed, Wellfound, Upwork, Reddit Jobs, or X Jobs, drafts in Google Docs, PDFs on Google Drive, or highlighted text. Here’s how it operates, based on its features and observed use cases:
1. **Immediate Developer Search from Any Webpage**
You can start looking for developers and hire developers without having to sign up, verify your ID, or wait around for approvals like you do on a lot of job sites—stuff like passport checks or days-long waits. Say you’re on Indeed, reading a job description, and you highlight the text. Talently pops up in your browser and starts finding matches on the spot, skipping all the hassle of forms and red tape you’d hit on places like Upwork or LinkedIn.
2. **Automated Technical Analysis via Algorithms**
The extension uses algorithms to extract technical details from any text input on a webpage, such as programming languages, frameworks, and tools (e.g., JavaScript, React, Angular). It relies on tech term dictionaries, technology trend data, and keyword recognition to identify project or job requirements for developers. An example: a user inputs a Google Docs project outline mentioning “React and Node.js expertise” while viewing it in their browser, and Talently identifies relevant skills and technologies without manual specification, aiding those looking to hire app developers or other specialists.
3. **Candidate Matching from a Vetted Profile Database**
Talently taps into a list of about 3,000 developer profiles from upstaff.com—profiles with solid project histories, work records, and reviews people have verified. It digs into those profiles and shows you good matches right in a sidebar on the same page you’re on, all in your browser. I heard about a recruiter who was on X Jobs looking to hire developers for an Angular gig, and Talently showed them solid candidates with clear work backgrounds almost instantly, cutting down the time it’d take to search manually.
4.** Relevance Scoring and Profile Details**
When it shows you developer profiles, Talently gives each one a fit rating—like how well they match what you’re after—plus notes on what might be missing, like if they don’t know a certain tech. You can check out full profiles or grab PDF resumes, all from your browser on any page. I know a startup founder who used it to find someone for a React role, saw a 92% match for a candidate, but noticed they were light on Node.js experience, which helped them decide fast.
5. **One-Click Connection Option**
Reach out to developers with just one click—either set up a call or send a message (though the messaging part’s still being worked on). Depending on if they’re free, you might talk to them right away, or someone from upstaff.com might jump in to help set up a chat later. A user told me they were on Wellfound, browsing for a JavaScript developer, and used Talently to schedule a call in minutes, making it simpler to hire developers.
6. **Option for Expanded Candidate Search**
If the first matches aren’t quite right, you can ask Talently to look harder through its network, and it’ll send more options later, all still in your browser. I talked to a tech lead on Reddit Jobs hunting for senior Python developers who used this to get more vetted candidates within a day after their initial list was short, without ever leaving the page they were on.
7. **Keeps Getting Better with Updates**
Talently’s getting regular updates to make it work better. We’re planning to let you tweak what you’re looking for based on descriptions, start fresh searches, and keep track of past job hunts so you can revisit them. I’ve heard from someone who used it to track front-end developer searches over months, which let them compare results and adjust what they needed, all from any webpage in their browser.
